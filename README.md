# MY Raytracer! (WiP)


### Description

This is my WiP implementation of the Ray tracer as described in the book "The Ray Tracer Challenge" by  [https://pragprog.com/book/jbtracer/the-ray-tracer-challenge](https://pragprog.com/book/jbtracer/the-ray-tracer-challenge).


**Milestone Tracking**
Keeping Track of Milestones(Chapters completed)

-    Pass pointers to arrays for certain method calls
-    Assembler impl of vector * matrix multiplication through  [c2goasm](https://github.com/minio/c2goasm)
-   Depth of field
-   Soft shadows and multisampling
-  Bounding boxes for groups and CSGs (based on bonus chapter from book)

**How to run**
	Git Clone -
	
	
	git clone git@github.com:brentshierk/raytracer.git
Navigate to the root directory of ray tracer -
	

    go run main.go
    
    

There's a lot that is still incomplete, Im currently still running into issues 

While all test cases from the are being implemented the next major step will be getting the 
ball image to properly render.
